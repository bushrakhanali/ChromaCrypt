//Question # 14

//Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. 
//Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.



// Solve Q:14

// Guest Names
let guest_List :string[] = ['Naseema','Kulsoom','Manahil','Munazza']; 

//  Print Message to them
const moreabout :string = 'Dear Friend'
const invitations :string = ' \n\nIts glade to see you on my Dinner. Looking forward to seeing you. '; 
const  morre :string = '\n\nThanks!';

// Using for loop
for (let  i=0;  i<guest_List.length; i++) {


    console.log(moreabout + guest_List[i] + invitations + morre);
}



//                 ---x-x-x-x-x-x---
