// Question # 13

// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, 
//  such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. 
//   Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

// Solve Q:13


// Store my favorite mode of transoportation in an Array
let motors :string[] = ['Lamborghini ','Farari ','500 cc Motorbike ','privat Jet '];

// and also print message for it
const information :string = 'I will be able to buy my own ';
const theday :string = 'Inshallah';

//Using for loop
for (let i=0; i<motors.length; i++) {

//print the message and mode of transportation 
      console.log(information + motors[i] + theday);


}
